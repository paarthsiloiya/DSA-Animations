    <h3>What is a Doubly Linked List?</h3>
    <p>
        A <strong>doubly linked list</strong> is an extension of the singly linked list that enhances flexibility by
        allowing traversal in both forward and backward directions. Unlike a singly linked list, where each node only
        points to the <em>next</em> node in the sequence, a doubly linked list node includes an additional pointer that
        refers to the <em>previous</em> node. This addition provides significant benefits for certain operations.
    </p>

    <h3>Node Structure</h3>
    <p>Each <strong>node</strong> in a doubly linked list typically consists of three parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>key</strong> or <strong>data</strong> attribute, which holds the actual value of the element.</li>
        <li>A <strong>next</strong> pointer, which points to the subsequent node in the sequence.</li>
        <li>
            A <strong>pre</strong> (or <strong>prev</strong>) pointer, which points to the preceding node in the
            sequence.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The list itself often maintains a pointer to its <strong>head</strong> (the first node). For the first node, its
        <code>pre</code> pointer is <code>None</code> (or null), indicating it has no predecessor. Similarly, the last
        node in the list has its <code>next</code> pointer set to <code>None</code>, indicating the end of the list. An
        empty list is denoted by <code>L.head = None</code>. In some implementations, a <strong>sentinel</strong> (dummy
        object) can be used to simplify boundary conditions, connecting the head and tail in a circular fashion and
        eliminating the need for <code>None</code> checks at the ends.

    <h3>Operations on Doubly Linked Lists and Their Time Complexity</h3>
    <p>
        Here is an in-depth explanation of common operations performed on doubly linked lists, along with their best,
        worst, and average time complexities:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Searching an Element (<code>LIST-SEARCH</code>)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Description</strong>: To find an element with a specific key <code>k</code>, the list must
                    be traversed sequentially, starting from the head (or the tail if searching backward is desired).
                    Each node's key is checked until the desired element is found or the end of the list (None) is
                    reached.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Time Complexity</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Best Case</strong>: <strong>$O(1)$</strong>. This occurs when the target element is
                            the first node in the list. Only one comparison is needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Worst Case</strong>: <strong>$O(n)$</strong>. This occurs when the target element is
                            the last node in the list, or if it is not present at all. In such cases, the algorithm must
                            examine all <code>n</code> elements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Average Case</strong>: <strong>$O(n)$</strong>. Assuming the element is equally
                            likely to be at any position, the average number of elements examined is proportional to
                            <code>n</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mathematical Calculation</strong>: The number of comparisons is directly proportional to the
                    position of the element in the list, up to <code>n</code> comparisons in the worst case.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Accessing an Element by Index (<code>Get-At</code>)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Description</strong>: Similar to searching by key, accessing an element at a particular
                    index <code>i</code> requires traversing the list from the head (or tail, if closer) until the
                    <em>i</em>-th element is reached. Unlike arrays, doubly linked lists do not support random access.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Time Complexity</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Best Case</strong>: <strong>$O(1)$</strong>, for the first element.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Worst Case</strong>: <strong>$O(n)$</strong>, for the last element, as it requires
                            <code>n</code> steps of traversal.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Average Case</strong>: <strong>$O(n)$</strong>, as the average number of steps is
                            proportional to <code>n</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mathematical Calculation</strong>: Up to <code>n</code> steps of pointer traversal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Insertion of an Element (<code>LIST-INSERT</code>)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Description</strong>: A new node <code>x</code> can be inserted at various positions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>At the Head</strong>: The new node <code>x</code>'s <code>next</code> pointer is set
                            to the current head, <code>x</code>'s <code>pre</code> pointer is set to None (or sentinel),
                            the old head's <code>pre</code> pointer is updated to <code>x</code>, and
                            <code>x</code> becomes the new head.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>At the Tail</strong>: If a <code>tail</code> pointer is maintained for the list (as
                            seen in some implementations), or if a circular list with a sentinel is used, a new node
                            <code>x</code> can be appended to the end. <code>x</code>'s <code>pre</code> points to the
                            old tail, <code>x</code>'s <code>next</code> points to None (or sentinel), and the old
                            tail's <code>next</code> pointer is updated to <code>x</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>In the Middle</strong>: If a pointer to the <em>predecessor</em> node
                            <code>y</code> (or the node itself <code>y</code>) is known, <code>x</code> can be inserted
                            between <code>y</code> and <code>y.next</code>. <code>x</code>'s <code>pre</code> points to
                            <code>y</code>, <code>x</code>'s <code>next</code> points to <code>y.next</code>,
                            <code>y.next</code>'s <code>pre</code> points to <code>x</code>, and <code>y.next</code> is
                            updated to <code>x</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Time Complexity</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>At Head/Tail/Middle (given reference)</strong>: <strong>$O(1)$</strong>. This is a
                            constant-time operation because it only involves changing a few pointers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>In Middle (by value/index, without direct pointer)</strong>:
                            <strong>$O(n)$</strong>. This requires a prior search ($O(n)$) to locate the insertion
                            point.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mathematical Calculation</strong>: A constant number of pointer updates (e.g., 3-5 updates)
                    if the insertion point's predecessor is known.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Deletion of an Element (<code>LIST-DELETE</code>)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Description</strong>: To remove a node <code>x</code>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>If given a pointer to <code>x</code></strong
                            >: <code>x</code>'s predecessor (<code>x.pre</code>) has its <code>next</code> pointer
                            updated to <code>x</code>'s successor (<code>x.next</code>), and <code>x</code>'s successor
                            (<code>x.next</code>) has its <code>pre</code> pointer updated to <code>x</code>'s
                            predecessor (<code>x.pre</code>). Special handling is needed if <code>x</code> is the head
                            or tail, or if sentinels are not used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>If deleting by key (or by index)</strong>: The list must first be searched to find
                            the node <code>x</code> to be deleted.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Time Complexity</strong>:

                            >: <strong>$O(1)$</strong>. This is a constant-time operation due to the
                            <code>pre</code> pointer, which allows direct update of both preceding and succeeding nodes.
                            This is a key advantage over singly linked lists where deleting a node without its
                            predecessor often takes $O(n)$.

                    <strong>Description</strong>: Unless the list is sorted, finding the minimum or maximum element

                    <strong>Time Complexity</strong>: <strong>$O(n)$</strong>. This requires visiting every node in the
                    list. While there are specialized "XOR linked lists" that can reverse in $O(1)$, this is not typical
                    for a general doubly linked list.

    <h3>Comparison to Singly Linked Lists and Arrays</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Random Access</strong>: Like singly linked lists, doubly linked lists offer only
            <strong>sequential access</strong>, which means accessing an element by its index still requires $O(n)$ time
            in the worst case. Arrays, in contrast, provide <strong>$O(1)$</strong> random access.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Insertions and Deletions</strong>: Doubly linked lists excel at insertions and deletions when a
            pointer to the target node (or its predecessor/successor) is already known. These operations can be done in
            <strong>$O(1)$</strong> time because both <code>next</code> and <code>pre</code> pointers can be updated
            efficiently. For singly linked lists, while insertion at the head is $O(1)$, deletion of an arbitrary node
            (without its predecessor) or insertion/deletion at the tail without a tail pointer can be $O(n)$.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Space Complexity</strong>: Doubly linked lists require more memory per node than singly linked lists
            (and arrays) due to the extra <code>pre</code> pointer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Traversal</strong>: Doubly linked lists allow efficient traversal in both forward and backward
            directions, which can be useful for certain algorithms or specific requirements. Singly linked lists only
            support forward traversal.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In essence, if a singly linked list is like a string of pearls where each pearl is tied to the
        <em>next</em> one, allowing you to only move forward along the string, a doubly linked list is like a string of
        magnetic pearls where each pearl is attracted to both the <em>next</em> and <em>previous</em> pearls. This
        magnetic connection allows you to pick any pearl and easily find the one before it or after it, making it
        simpler to add or remove pearls anywhere in the middle without disrupting the entire string, even if it uses a
        bit more material for each pearl.
