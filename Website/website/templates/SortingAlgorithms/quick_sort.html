<h1>Quick Sort Algorithm</h1>

<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>What is Quick Sort Algorithm?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Quick Sort is an efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm</strong> widely used for sorting large
        datasets. It is based on the <strong>divide-and-conquer strategy</strong>, which involves breaking down a larger
        problem into smaller subproblems, solving them recursively, and combining the results.
    </p>
    <p>The Quick Sort algorithm follows three main steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Divide (Partitioning Step)</strong>: The array is
            <strong>partitioned around a pivot element <code>last element (in this case)</code></strong
            >. All elements smaller than or equal to the pivot are moved to the left, and elements greater than the
            pivot are moved to the right. The final position of the pivot element (often referred to as <code>q</code>)
            marks the split point.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conquer</strong>: The algorithm is then
            <strong>recursively applied to the left and right sub-arrays</strong>
            formed by the partition step.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Combine</strong>: No additional merging is required because
            <strong>Quick Sort sorts the array in-place</strong>. Once the recursive steps are complete, the entire
            array is sorted.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <strong>base case</strong> of the recursion is when the sub-array has zero or one element, as such arrays
        are already sorted.
    </p>

    <h3>Applications of Quick Sort</h3>
    <p>
        Despite its worst-case time complexity of <code>O(n²)</code> (which occurs with poorly chosen pivots),
        <strong>Quick Sort is often the most practical choice for sorting large input arrays</strong> due to its
        <strong>average-case efficiency and low memory overhead</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>General-Purpose Sorting</strong>: Many programming languages and standard libraries use Quick Sort
            or its variants (e.g., C's <code>qsort</code>) due to its <strong>fast average performance</strong>
            and simplicity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Large Datasets</strong>: Quick Sort is ideal for sorting <strong>large arrays or lists</strong>
            because it minimizes memory usage and requires no additional storage beyond the input array.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Efficient in Virtual Memory Environments</strong>: Due to its sequential memory access patterns,
            Quick Sort performs well in environments where virtual memory is used.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Used in Hybrid Sorting Algorithms</strong>: Many high-performance sorting implementations
            <strong>switch to Insertion Sort</strong> for small subarrays (e.g., less than 10 elements), combining the
            speed of Quick Sort with the efficiency of simpler algorithms for small inputs.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>Complexity Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        The running time of Quick Sort heavily <strong>depends on the choice of the pivot element</strong> and how
        balanced the partitions are.
    </p>
    <h4>Time Complexity</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Worst-Case Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$ or $\Theta(n^2)$</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The worst-case scenario occurs when the
                    <strong>partitioning routine consistently produces unbalanced splits</strong>, for instance, one
                    subproblem with <code>n-1</code> elements and another with <code>0</code> elements. This happens
                    when the pivot chosen is always the smallest or largest element in the array.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For example, if the input array is already sorted in increasing or decreasing order, and the pivot
                    is chosen as a corner element, Quick Sort exhibits worst-case behaviour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this case, the recurrence relation for the running time is
                    <code>T(n) = T(n-1) + T(0) + Θ(n)</code>, where <code>T(0) = Θ(1)</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Summing the costs at each level of recursion results in an arithmetic series, leading to a
                    <strong>quadratic running time of $\Theta(n^2)$</strong>. This means Quick Sort is as slow as
                    Selection Sort or Insertion Sort in its worst case. The stack size in the worst case is also $O(n)$.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Best-Case Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$ or $\Theta(n \log n)$</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The best case occurs when the <strong>partitioning is perfectly balanced</strong>, dividing the
                    array into two subproblems of nearly equal size (e.g., <code>n/2</code> elements each).
                </li>
                <li>The recurrence relation for this ideal split is <code>T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n)</code>.</li>
                <li>
                    This recurrence can be solved using the <strong>Master Theorem</strong>, yielding a
                    <strong>time complexity of $\Theta(n \log n)$</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>This is the asymptotic lower limit for comparison-based sorts.</li>
                <li>
                    The number of levels in the recursion tree (height of the call stack) is $O(\log n)$. Each level of
                    partitioning takes $O(n)$ time.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Average-Case Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$ or $\Theta(n \log n)$</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The average-case performance of Quick Sort is
                    <strong>much closer to the best case than to the worst case</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Even with significantly unbalanced partitions (e.g., a 9-to-1 split), Quick Sort still runs in $O(n
                    \log n)$ time asymptotically. This is because any split of constant proportionality results in a
                    recursion tree depth of $O(\log n)$, with $O(n)$ cost at each level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On average, if a random element is chosen as the pivot, Quick Sort completes in $O(n \log n)$ time.
                    The expected running time relies on the idea that even a bad split followed by a good split can
                    result in an overall good split, as the cost of the bad split is absorbed into the good one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The total number of comparisons in the average case is $O(n \log n)$. The probability of choosing
                    any particular element as the pivot is <code>1/n</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In practice, Quick Sort is often faster than Merge Sort due to a
                    <strong>smaller constant factor</strong> hidden within the Big O notation.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Space Complexity</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Auxiliary Space: $O(\log n)$ in average case, $O(n)$ in worst case</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Quick Sort is generally considered an <strong>in-place sorting algorithm</strong>, meaning it sorts
                    by rearranging elements within the array and requires only a small, constant amount of auxiliary
                    memory beyond the input array itself for data storage ($O(1)$ for a few variables like pivot and
                    indices).
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, the recursive calls consume space on the <strong>call stack</strong>. In the best and
                    average cases (balanced partitions), the recursion depth is $O(\log n)$, leading to $O(\log n)$
                    stack space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the worst case (unbalanced partitions), the recursion depth can be $O(n)$, leading to $O(n)$
                    stack space. This stack depth can be optimized to $O(\log n)$ in the worst case by implementing
                    <strong>tail recursion optimization</strong> and sorting the smaller sub-array first.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>Stability</h3>
    <p><strong>Quick Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Quick Sort's partitioning process, especially when elements equal to the pivot are involved, does not
            guarantee the preservation of relative order for equal elements. For instance, if there are multiple
            occurrences of a value, their original relative order might change after sorting.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>High Average-Case Performance</strong>: Quick Sort is
            <strong>remarkably efficient on average</strong>, with an expected running time of $O(n \log n)$.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Small Constant Factors</strong>: It has <strong>tight code</strong>, meaning the constant factors
            hidden in its $O(n \log n)$ notation are quite small, making it very fast in practice compared to other $O(n
            \log n)$ algorithms like Merge Sort.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>In-Place Sorting</strong>: It sorts <strong>in place</strong>, requiring $O(1)$ auxiliary memory for
            element rearrangement (excluding the recursion stack). This is a valuable feature in memory-constrained
            environments, such as embedded systems.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Adaptability to Randomization</strong>: Randomizing the pivot selection can help ensure that the
            average-case performance is achieved consistently, making the worst-case behavior unlikely for any specific
            input.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Divide-and-Conquer Paradigm</strong>: Its recursive, divide-and-conquer nature makes it relatively
            easy to parallelize.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Worst-Case Time Complexity</strong>: Its most significant drawback is its
            <strong>quadratic time complexity ($O(n^2)$) in the worst case</strong>. This makes it highly inefficient
            for certain inputs (e.g., already sorted or reverse-sorted arrays, depending on pivot choice) that could
            trigger the worst case.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Not Stable</strong>: Quick Sort is <strong>not a stable sorting algorithm</strong>. If maintaining
            the original relative order of equal elements is important, Quick Sort is not suitable unless modified or
            combined with a stable approach.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Recursion Overhead</strong>: The recursive calls involve overhead from managing the call stack,
            which can be $O(n)$ in the worst case if not optimized.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Not Suitable for Linked Lists</strong>: While Quick Sort has advantages for vector storage like
            arrays, it is <strong>not suitable for linked lists</strong> because elements cannot be swapped efficiently
            and random access is not available. This contrasts with Merge Sort, which works well with linked lists.
        </li>
    </ul>
