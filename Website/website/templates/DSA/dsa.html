<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</h1>
<p>
    Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental field in computer science that combines two core concepts:
    <strong>algorithms</strong> and <strong>data structures</strong>.
</p>
<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>What is DSA?</h3>
    <p>
        DSA refers to the combined study and application of
        <strong>data structures</strong> and <strong>algorithms</strong> to efficiently solve computational problems. It
        is a critical aspect of computer programming.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>Why is DSA required?</h3>
    <p>
        Algorithms lie at the <strong>heart of computing</strong> and are considered a <strong>technology</strong>,
        similar to fast hardware or graphical user interfaces. The study of algorithms is crucial because:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Efficiency matters</strong>: While computers are fast, they are not infinitely fast, and memory is
            not free. Different algorithms designed to solve the same problem can differ dramatically in their
            efficiency, and these differences can be far more significant than hardware or software improvements.
            Selecting efficient algorithms is as important for total system performance as choosing fast hardware.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Problem-solving</strong>: Algorithms provide well-defined computational procedures for solving a
            wide range of problems, from sorting a sequence of numbers to finding the shortest path between two points
            in a network or designing AI. Having a strong foundation in algorithmic knowledge and techniques is what
            distinguishes skilled programmers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Foundation for advanced topics</strong>: Elementary algorithms are fundamental and serve as building
            blocks for understanding more complex algorithms and data structures.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>What are Data Structures?</h3>
    <p>
        A
        <strong>
            <a href="{{ url_for('views.data_structures') }}">data structure</a> is a way to store and organise
            data</strong
        >
        to facilitate access and modifications. They are considered the building blocks for other complex data
        structures and algorithms.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data structures can be <strong>dynamic</strong>, meaning they can grow, shrink, or change over time.</li>
        <li>
            No single data structure is optimal for all purposes; therefore, it is important to understand the
            <strong>strengths and limitations</strong> of various types.
        </li>
        <li>
            Common examples of basic data structures include
            <strong>arrays and linked lists</strong>, which are widely used and form the basis for more advanced
            structures like hash tables.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>What are Algorithms?</h3>
    <p>
        An
        <strong
            ><a href="{{ url_for('views.algorithms') }}">algorithm</a> is any well-defined computational procedure that
            takes input values and produces output values</strong
        >. It is essentially a
        <strong>sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Algorithms can be viewed as
            <strong>tools for solving well-specified computational problems</strong>, where the problem statement
            defines the desired input/output relationship, and the algorithm describes the specific procedure to achieve
            it.
        </li>
        <li>
            An algorithm must be precise and can be specified in various ways, such as in English, pseudocode, or as a
            computer program. Pseudocode is often used to convey the algorithm's essence clearly, without being tied to
            a specific programming language.
        </li>
        <li>
            A key characteristic is that an algorithm's operations must be basic enough to be executed within a finite
            amount of time.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="subcontent">
    <h3>What is Efficiency of Algorithms?</h3>
    <p>
        The
        <strong>efficiency of an algorithm refers to the resources it requires to perform its task</strong>. When
        evaluating efficiency, the primary concerns are often:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Computational time</strong>: How long an algorithm takes to produce its result. This is measured by
            counting the number of operations an algorithm performs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Space in memory</strong>: The amount of memory or storage occupied by the algorithm as a function of
            the input size.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The goal is generally to choose the most efficient algorithm, whether optimising for time or space. It's crucial
        to understand how the running time of an algorithm <strong>increases as the input size grows</strong>, rather
        than just its raw speed in seconds. A faster algorithm performs fewer operations. For instance, if an algorithm
        performs a number of operations equal to the square of its input size $O(n)$, it is slower than one that
        performs operations proportional to its input size $O(n)$.
