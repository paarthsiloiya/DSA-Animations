<h1>Searching Algorithms</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Searching</strong> is a fundamental algorithmic problem which involves locating a specific value or set of
    values, known as an item or key, within a larger collection of data. An algorithm for searching takes some input and
    produces an output indicating the position of the item if found, or a special value like NIL or null if it is not
    present. The efficiency of search algorithms is measured by their <strong>time complexity</strong>, which describes
    how the number of operations grows with the size of the input.

    <h3>When to Use Searching</h3>
    <p>
        Searching algorithms are
        <strong>ubiquitous in practical applications</strong>. Here are some scenarios where they are crucial:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Retrieval</strong> Searching for specific information in databases, such as looking up a
            username in Facebook's database to verify an account. This also applies to finding product prices in a
            grocery store inventory.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Navigation and Routing</strong> Finding optimal routes in road networks (like with GPS devices) or
            determining good routes for data travel on the Internet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Information Management</strong> Utilised by search engines to quickly find web pages containing
            particular information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Security and Cryptography</strong> Core to electronic commerce technologies like public-key
            cryptography and digital signatures, which rely on numerical algorithms and number theory. Hash functions
            are also used for checking passwords and comparing files.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Resource Allocation</strong> Helping commercial enterprises determine the most beneficial way to
            allocate scarce resources, such as optimising oil well placement or airline crew assignments using linear
            programming.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pattern Recognition and Matching</strong> Used in substring searching for text editing programs,
            such as finding occurrences of a pattern string in a text. Also used for detecting plagiarism and finding
            similar items (e.g., detecting duplicate web pages).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Problem Solving and Optimisation</strong> Employed in solving various puzzles like mazes and finding
            solutions for complex problems where candidates may not directly exist.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Compression</strong> For techniques like Huffman coding, which compresses data by building an
            optimal representation of characters as binary strings.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cache Management</strong> In systems using a cache, search is used to determine if an item is
            already present (cache hit) or needs to be retrieved (cache miss).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Searching Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        Numerous search algorithms have been developed, each with its own strengths and limitations. Here are some types
        of search algorithms:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="{{ url_for('views.linear_search') }}">Linear Search</a></strong> A simple method that scans
            through a sequence element by element.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="{{ url_for('views.binary_search') }}">Binary Search</a></strong> A divide-and-conquer
            algorithm that efficiently finds an element in a <strong>sorted search space</strong> by repeatedly halving
            the search range.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Hash Table Searching (Hashing)</strong> Utilises a hash function to map keys to array indices,
            allowing for fast, often constant-time, lookups on average.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> A graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path (in
            terms of number of edges) from a source node to other nodes in a graph.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong> A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along
            each branch before backtracking.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm</strong> An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph
            with <strong>weighted edges</strong>.
        </li>
    </ul>
